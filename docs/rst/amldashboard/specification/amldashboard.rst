AML Dashboard
#############

The *AML Dashboard* serves as a user-friendly tool for training, evaluating, and applying |aml| models to expressive gestures in music exploration.
Built upon the `Marcelle <https://marcelle.dev/>`__ framework, the dashboard offers standard interaction :term:`GUI`\s and the ability to create custom interactive widgets compatible with Marcelle's structure.

The primary goal of the *AML Dashboard* is to enable users to:

1. Collect personal gesture data.
2. Train classifiers using the *AML Engine*.
3. Apply classified gesture data in a music exploration context.

To achieve this, the *AML Dashboard* integrates four main interfaces:

1. **Gesture Input Interface**: Allows users to collect data through user-defined input gestures.
2. **Training Interface**: Facilitates the training of |aml| models based on user-generated datasets.
3. **Model Exploration Interface**: Enables users to explore and compare the capabilities of |aml| models with other :term:`ML` approaches.
4. **Music Exploration Interface**: Applies the trained |aml| algorithm in real-time, enabling users to explore new sound patterns using personal gestures.
