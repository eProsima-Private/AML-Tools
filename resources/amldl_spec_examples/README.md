# AMLDL Specification

This folder contains the AML-DL Specification, the implementation of the
AML-DL Specification in Python, and the set of examples described in the
AML-DL Specification document.

The Python implementation of the AML-DL Specification is provided as
a Python moudule. That module, `amldl.py`, fully conforms to the AML-DL
Specification and allows the user to produce AML embeddings as described in the
specification document.

Here we also provide 3 examples, that closely follow those in the document,
and can be used as a reference.

We also include a file that reads these embeddings and outputs a summary
of their content. This file can be used as a reference on how to make actual
use of an embedding once created.
